## Introduction

Tessera was created to bring a next-generation UI framework to the Rust ecosystem with GPU-first performance and a modern, ergonomic component model. We believe UI development should be high-performance, highly flexible, and fun.

## Purpose

The project aims to provide Rust with a modern, permissive, developer-friendly, and high-performance UI framework.
